# Graph
This program generates a random vertex edge graph, and finds the distance
k-dominating set of the generated graph.

Vertex edge graphs are used in Graph Theory to represent socal networks and
other relationships. 

The distance k-dominating set a set of vertices V in the graph G such that all
vertices are either within k steps of a vertex in the dominating set or have a
neighbor that is.

# Getting Started
You will need an up to date copy of processing. Once you have a copy of
processing you can open the sketch folder from processing's ide and run it
there. 

Processing can also work from the commandline or terminal. You will need to add
the folder containing processing-java to your enviroment path. 

You can then run the sketch by typing
	processing-java --sketch=Graph --run
from the directory containing the Graph directory.




# Built with:
